## Prerequisites

- Python Latest Version
- Jupyter Notebook
- Streamlit
- 
##  Usage

A spam mail detection system using machine learning employs algorithms to automatically identify and filter out spam emails by analyzing content, sender behavior, and metadata. By continuously learning and adapting, it offers more accurate and adaptive protection, reducing the risk of phishing, malware, and unwanted messages, enhancing email security.

### Algorithm Used
- Multinomial Naive Bayes is a common algorithm for spam mail detection. It models the frequency of words in emails and calculates the probability of a message being spam or not. By analyzing the occurrence of words and their frequency, it's effective in distinguishing between legitimate emails and spam, aiding in accurate filtering.

### Streamlit to Visualize
- Streamlit is used for rapidly creating web applications with Python. It simplifies the development process, enabling data scientists and developers to build interactive and data-driven apps effortlessly. With its straightforward syntax, it's ideal for prototyping, sharing data insights, and creating user-friendly dashboards, making it a popular choice for data visualization and web app deployment.

### Features Implemented
- Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm
- Python Programming
- Read Dataset
- Training and Testing
- Output Prediction
